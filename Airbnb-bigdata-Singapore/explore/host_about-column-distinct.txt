|I'm a Singaporean mother of two boys.  I've been hosting on Airbnb for more than 4 years, serving more than 400 guests from 30 cities, with 2 listings, one in Singapore and one in Puteri Harbour, Nusajaya Johor, near Legoland.  I enjoy travelling, cruising and trying new foods.  My homes are decorated in Contemporary to Balinese decor, reflecting my personal tastes for modern luxury, yet with a relaxed resort feel. I love the accessories that complete the interior design, guests can see this from our Art pieces, lightings, ethnic carpets and various decorations in our homes. Our guests are our friends, we wish to leave them with warm, joyful memories of their stays with us.

우리 집에 온 걸 환영 해요!|
|I am a geeky data scientist in Singapore with my wife Callie. We are  from China and want to make friends from all over the world. We are both AOW license holders and love diving. Staying with us will be fun and being my guests will be an amazing experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
