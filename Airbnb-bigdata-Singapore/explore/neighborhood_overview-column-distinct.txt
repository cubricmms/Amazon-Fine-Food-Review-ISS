|The estate, with its promise of heady nostalgia and cool café vibes, lures a steady flow of devotees who trample through the neighbourhood for that perfect, sunlit cupcake shot. Tiong Bahru’s unique design is partly responsible for the camera-wielding masses who visit the neighbourhood weekly in search of Instagram fodder. The beautiful design of Tiong Bahru flats developed before the war is termed Streamline Moderne, and was inspired by the speed and movement of transport technology in the 20th century. Look closely and you will find that the blocks along Guan Chuan Street and Chay Yan Street, with their long, clean horizontal lines, curved forms and porthole windows, seem to resemble an ocean liner. In fact, the elongated blocks replete with horizontal lines along Tiong Poh Road earned them the nickname “Aeroplane blocks”.                                                                                                                                                                    |

It is important to take note that Singapore government has outlawed short term stay via Airbnb. There are many cases in which the hosts are forced to cancel reservations after being caught.
